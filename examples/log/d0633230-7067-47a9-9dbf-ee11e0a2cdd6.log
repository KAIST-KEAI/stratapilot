2024-01-04 20:16:06,251 - INFO - To complete the task of finding out which other predictor base command received a bug fix in the Scikit-Learn July 2017 changelog, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Since the changelog is not a local file in the current working directory, we need to retrieve the Scikit-Learn July 2017 changelog from the internet. This will be an API subtask, as it involves obtaining data from internet resources.

2. Once we have the changelog, we need to search through the text to find the section that mentions bug fixes for predictor base commands. This will be a QA subtask, as it involves analyzing the text content returned by the API subtask to answer the question.

Here is the JSON representation of the subtasks:

```json
{
    "retrieve_changelog": {
        "name": "retrieve_changelog",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API to retrieve the Scikit-Learn July 2017 changelog from the internet.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "find_predictor_base_bug_fix": {
        "name": "find_predictor_base_bug_fix",
        "description": "Analyze the text of the Scikit-Learn July 2017 changelog to find out which other predictor base command received a bug fix.",
        "dependencies": ["retrieve_changelog"],
        "type": "QA"
    }
}
```

The first subtask, "retrieve_changelog," uses the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API to fetch the changelog. The second subtask, "find_predictor_base_bug_fix," depends on the output of the first subtask and involves analyzing the text to extract the required information.
2024-01-04 20:16:06,252 - INFO - The current subtask is: Use the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API to retrieve the Scikit-Learn July 2017 changelog from the internet.
2024-01-04 20:16:46,594 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2024-01-04 20:16:46,595 - INFO - To complete the user-specified task, we need to call the `/tools/bing/load_pagev2` API with the appropriate parameters to retrieve the Scikit-Learn July 2017 changelog. Since the API documentation specifies that the `url` parameter is required and the `query` parameter can be used to guide the search towards relevant information, we will need to provide the URL of the Scikit-Learn changelog page for July 2017 and a query that helps identify the changelog section.

Here is the code to perform the API call:

```python
from jarvis.core.tool_request_util import ToolRequestUtil

# Initialize the ToolRequestUtil
tool_request_util = ToolRequestUtil()

# Define the API path
api_path = '/tools/bing/load_pagev2'

# Define the method to be used for the API call
method = 'get'

# Define the parameters for the API call
# Assuming that the Scikit-Learn changelog URL is known and follows a predictable pattern
# such as 'https://scikit-learn.org/stable/whats_new/v0.19.html' for the July 2017 release (version 0.19)
params = {
    "url": "https://scikit-learn.org/stable/whats_new/v0.19.html",
    "query": "July 2017 changelog"  # This query is to guide the search, assuming the changelog mentions the month and year
}

# Define the content type for the API call
content_type = 'application/json'

# Make the API call and print the return value
response = tool_request_util.request(api_path, method, params=params, content_type=content_type)
print(response)
```

Please note that the actual URL for the Scikit-Learn July 2017 changelog might differ, so you would need to replace the `url` parameter with the correct URL if it's different from the one assumed in the example above. The `query` parameter is also an assumption based on the task description and might need to be adjusted to accurately reflect the content of the changelog page.

We have some new algorithms in existing estimators, such as multiplicative update in decomposition.NMF and multinomial linear_model.LogisticRegression with L1 loss (use solver='saga'). Cross validation is now able to return the results from multiple metric evaluations. The new model_selection.cross_validate can return many scores on the test data as well as training set performance and timings, and we have extended the scoring and refit parameters for grid/randomized search to handle multiple metrics. You can also learn faster. For instance, the new option to cache transformations in pipeline.Pipeline makes grid search over pipelines including slow transformations much more efficient. And you can predict faster: if you’re sure you know what you’re doing, you can turn off validating that the input is finite using config_context. We’ve made some important fixes too. We’ve fixed a longstanding implementation error in metrics.average_precision_score, so please be cautious with prior results reported from that function. A number of errors in the manifold.TSNE implementation have been fixed, particularly in the default Barnes-Hut approximation. semi_supervised.LabelSpreading and semi_supervised.LabelPropagation have had substantial fixes. LabelPropagation was previously broken. LabelSpreading should now correctly respect its alpha parameter. Changed models¶ The following estimators and functions, when fit with the same data and parameters, may produce different models from the previous version. This often occurs due to changes in the modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in random sampling procedures. cluster.KMeans with sparse X and initial centroids given (bug fix) cross_decomposition.PLSRegression with scale=True (bug fix) ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier and ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor where min_impurity_split is used (bug fix) gradient boosting loss='quantile' (bug fix) ensemble.IsolationForest (bug fix) feature_selection.SelectFdr (bug fix) linear_model.RANSACRegressor (bug fix) linear_model.LassoLars (bug fix) linear_model.LassoLarsIC (bug fix) manifold.TSNE (bug fix) neighbors.NearestCentroid (bug fix) semi_supervised.LabelSpreading (bug fix) semi_supervised.LabelPropagation (bug fix) tree based models where min_weight_fraction_leaf is used (enhancement) model_selection.StratifiedKFold with shuffle=True (this change, due to  7823 was not mentioned in the release notes at the time) Details are listed in the changelog below. (While we are trying to better inform users by providing this information, we cannot assure that this list is complete.) Changelog¶ New features¶ Classifiers and regressors Added multioutput.ClassifierChain for multi-label classification. By Adam Kleczewski. Added solver 'saga' that implements the improved version of Stochastic Average Gradient, in linear_model.LogisticRegression and linear_model.Ridge. It allows the use of L1 penalty with multinomial logistic loss, and behaves marginally better than ‘sag’ during the first epochs of ridge and logistic regression.  8446 by Arthur Mensch. Other estimators Added the neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor class for anomaly detection based on nearest neighbors.  5279 by Nicolas Goix and Alexandre Gramfort. Added preprocessing.QuantileTransformer class and preprocessing.quantile_transform function for features normalization based on quantiles.  8363 by Denis Engemann, Guillaume Lemaitre, Olivier Grisel, Raghav RV, Thierry Guillemot, and Gael Varoquaux. The new solver 'mu' implements a Multiplicate Update in decomposition.NMF, allowing the optimization of all beta-divergences,...Peter Wang. Fixed a bug where ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier throws ZeroDivisionError while fitting data with single class labels.  7501 by Dominik Krzeminski. Fixed a bug in ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier and ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor where a float being compared to 0.0 using = caused a divide by zero error.  7970 by He Chen. Fix a bug where ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier and ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor ignored the min_impurity_split parameter.  8006 by Sebastian Pölsterl. Fixed oob_score in ensemble.BaggingClassifier.  8936 by Michael Lewis Fixed excessive memory usage in prediction for random forests estimators.  8672 by Mike Benfield. Fixed a bug where sample_weight as a list broke random forests in Python 2  8068 by @xor. Fixed a bug where ensemble.IsolationForest fails when max_features is less than 1.  5732 by Ishank Gulati. Fix a bug where gradient boosting with loss='quantile' computed negative errors for negative values of ytrue - ypred leading to wrong values when calling __call__.  8087 by Alexis Mignon Fix a bug where ensemble.VotingClassifier raises an error when a numpy array is passed in for weights.  7983 by Vincent Pham. Fixed a bug where tree.export_graphviz raised an error when the length of features_names does not match n_features in the decision tree.  8512 by Li Li. Linear, kernelized and related models Fixed a bug where linear_model.RANSACRegressor.fit may run until max_iter if it finds a large inlier group early.  8251 by @aivision2020. Fixed a bug where naive_bayes.MultinomialNB and naive_bayes.BernoulliNB failed when alpha=0.  5814 by Yichuan Liu and Herilalaina Rakotoarison. Fixed a bug where linear_model.LassoLars does not give the same result as the LassoLars implementation available in R (lars library).  7849 by Jair Montoya Martinez. Fixed a bug in linear_model.RandomizedLasso, linear_model.Lars, linear_model.LassoLars, linear_model.LarsCV and linear_model.LassoLarsCV, where the parameter precompute was not used consistently across classes, and some values proposed in the docstring could raise errors.  5359 by Tom Dupre la Tour. Fix inconsistent results between linear_model.RidgeCV and linear_model.Ridge when using normalize=True.  9302 by Alexandre Gramfort. Fix a bug where linear_model.LassoLars.fit sometimes left coef_ as a list, rather than an ndarray.  8160 by CJ Carey. Fix linear_model.BayesianRidge.fit to return ridge parameter alpha_ and lambda_ consistent with calculated coefficients coef_ and intercept_.  8224 by Peter Gedeck. Fixed a bug in svm.OneClassSVM where it returned floats instead of integer classes.  8676 by Vathsala Achar. Fix AIC/BIC criterion computation in linear_model.LassoLarsIC.  9022 by Alexandre Gramfort and Mehmet Basbug. Fixed a memory leak in our LibLinear implementation.  9024 by Sergei Lebedev Fix bug where stratified CV splitters did not work with linear_model.LassoCV.  8973 by Paulo Haddad. Fixed a bug in gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor when the standard deviation and covariance predicted without fit would fail with a unmeaningful error by default.  6573 by Quazi Marufur Rahman and Manoj Kumar. Other predictors Fix semi_supervised.BaseLabelPropagation to correctly implement LabelPropagation and LabelSpreading as done in the referenced papers.  9239 by Andre Ambrosio Boechat, Utkarsh Upadhyay, and Joel Nothman. Decomposition, manifold learning and clustering Fixed the implementation of manifold.TSNE: early_exageration parameter had no effect and is now used for the first 250 optimization iterations. Fixed the AssertionError: Tree consistency failed exception reported in  8992. Improve the learning schedule to match the one from the reference implementation lvdmaaten/bhtsne. by Thomas Moreau and Olivier Grisel. Fix a bug in decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation where the perplexity method was returning incorrect results because the transform method returns normalized document topic distributions as of version 0.18.  7954 by Gary Foreman. Fix output shape and bugs with n_jobs > 1 in decomposition.SparseCoder transform and decomposition.sparse_encode for one-dimensional data and one component. This also impacts the output shape of decomposition.DictionaryLearning.  8086 by Andreas Müller.

Fixed the implementation of noise_variance_ in decomposition.PCA.  9108 by Hanmin...Version 0.19.2 — scikit-learn 1.3.2 documentation Toggle Menu PrevUp Next scikit-learn 1.3.2 Other versions Please cite us if you use the software. Version 0.19.2 Related changes Version 0.19.1 Changelog API changes Bug fixes Enhancements Code and Documentation Contributors Version 0.19 Highlights Changed models Changelog New features Enhancements Bug fixes API changes summary Code and Documentation Contributors Version 0.19.2¶ July, 2018 This release is exclusively in order to support Python 3.7. Related changes¶ n_iter_ may vary from previous releases in linear_model.LogisticRegression with solver='lbfgs' and linear_model.HuberRegressor. For Scipy <= 1.0.0, the optimizer could perform more than the requested maximum number of iterations. Now both estimators will report at most max_iter iterations even if more were performed.  10723 by Joel Nothman. Version 0.19.1¶ October 23, 2017 This is a bug-fix release with some minor documentation improvements and enhancements to features released in 0.19.0. Note there may be minor differences in TSNE output in this release (due to  9623), in the case where multiple samples have equal distance to some sample. Changelog¶ API changes¶ Reverted the addition of metrics.ndcg_score and metrics.dcg_score which had been merged into version 0.19.0 by error. The implementations were broken and undocumented. return_train_score which was added to model_selection.GridSearchCV, model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV and model_selection.cross_validate in version 0.19.0 will be changing its default value from True to False in version 0.21. We found that calculating training score could have a great effect on cross validation runtime in some cases. Users should explicitly set return_train_score to False if prediction or scoring functions are slow, resulting in a deleterious effect on CV runtime, or to True if they wish to use the calculated scores.  9677 by Kumar Ashutosh and Joel Nothman. correlation_models and regression_models from the legacy gaussian processes implementation have been belatedly deprecated.  9717 by Kumar Ashutosh. Bug fixes¶ Avoid integer overflows in metrics.matthews_corrcoef.  9693 by Sam Steingold. Fixed a bug in the objective function for manifold.TSNE (both exact and with the Barnes-Hut approximation) when n_components >= 3.  9711 by @goncalo-rodrigues. Fix regression in model_selection.cross_val_predict where it raised an error with method='predict_proba' for some probabilistic classifiers.  9641 by James Bourbeau. Fixed a bug where datasets.make_classification modified its input weights.  9865 by Sachin Kelkar. model_selection.StratifiedShuffleSplit now works with multioutput multiclass or multilabel data with more than 1000 columns.  9922 by Charlie Brummitt. Fixed a bug with nested and conditional parameter setting, e.g. setting a pipeline step and its parameter at the same time.  9945 by Andreas Müller and Joel Nothman. Regressions in 0.19.0 fixed in 0.19.1: Fixed a bug where parallelised prediction in random forests was not thread-safe and could (rarely) result in arbitrary errors.  9830 by Joel Nothman. Fix regression in model_selection.cross_val_predict where it no longer accepted X as a list.  9600 by Rasul Kerimov. Fixed handling of model_selection.cross_val_predict for binary classification with method='decision_function'.  9593 by Reiichiro Nakano and core devs. Fix regression in pipeline.Pipeline where it no longer accepted steps as a tuple.  9604 by Joris Van den Bossche. Fix bug where n_iter was not properly deprecated, leaving n_iter unavailable for interim use in linear_model.SGDClassifier, linear_model.SGDRegressor, linear_model.PassiveAggressiveClassifier, linear_model.PassiveAggressiveRegressor and linear_model.Perceptron.  9558 by Andreas Müller. Dataset fetchers make sure temporary files are closed before removing them, which caused errors on Windows.  9847 by Joan Massich. Fixed a regression in manifold.TSNE where it no longer supported metrics other than ‘euclidean’ and ‘precomputed’.  9623 by Oli Blum. Enhancements¶ Our test suite and utils.estimator_checks.check_estimator can now be run without Nose installed.  9697 by Joan Massich. To improve usability of version 0.19’s pipeline.Pipeline caching, memory now allows joblib.Memory instances. This make use of the new utils.validation.check_memory helper. issue:9584 by Kumar Ashutosh Some fixes to examples:  9750,  9788,  9815 Made a FutureWarning in SGD-based estimators less verbose.  9802 by"}
