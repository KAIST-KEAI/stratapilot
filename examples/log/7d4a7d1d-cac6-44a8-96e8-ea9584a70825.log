2024-01-06 14:13:32,978 - INFO - To complete the task of determining how long it took for the percentage of computer scientists that were women to change by 13% from a starting point of 37%, we need to find the relevant information from a reliable source. Since the task specifies "Girls Who Code" as the source, we will need to search the internet for this information. This task does not involve file operations or system operations, so we will plan an API subtask to search the web for the required information and then a QA subtask to analyze the content returned by the API subtask to answer the question.

Here is the decomposition into subtasks:

1. Use an API to search for information related to the change in the percentage of women computer scientists as reported by Girls Who Code.
2. Analyze the information retrieved to calculate the number of years it took for the percentage to change by 13% from a starting point of 37%.

Now, let's create the JSON representation of these subtasks:

```json
{
    "search_information": {
        "name": "search_information",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for information on how long it took for the percentage of computer scientists that were women to change by 13% from a starting point of 37%, as reported by Girls Who Code.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "analyze_information": {
        "name": "analyze_information",
        "description": "Analyze the information returned by the 'search_information' subtask to determine the number of years it took for the percentage to change by 13% from a starting point of 37%.",
        "dependencies": ["search_information"],
        "type": "QA"
    }
}
```

This JSON structure represents the subtasks needed to complete the main task, with the appropriate dependencies and types specified.
2024-01-06 14:13:32,978 - INFO - The current subtask is: Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for information on how long it took for the percentage of computer scientists that were women to change by 13% from a starting point of 37%, as reported by Girls Who Code.
2024-01-06 14:13:41,700 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2024-01-06 14:13:41,701 - INFO - To complete the user-specified task, we need to use the `/tools/bing/searchv2` API to search for information on the change in the percentage of computer scientists that were women, as reported by Girls Who Code. We will construct the query and make a GET request using the `ToolRequestUtil` tool.

Here's the code to perform the search:

```python
from jarvis.core.tool_request_util import ToolRequestUtil

# Initialize the ToolRequestUtil
tool_request_util = ToolRequestUtil()

# Define the API path and the search query
api_path = '/tools/bing/searchv2'
query = "change in percentage of women computer scientists from 37% Girls Who Code"

# Prepare the parameters for the API call
params = {
    "query": query,
    "top_k": None  # We can leave top_k as None or specify a number for the top results
}

# Make the GET request to the API
response = tool_request_util.request(api_path=api_path, method='get', params=params, content_type='application/json')

# Print the return value of the API
print(response)
```

This code will send a GET request to the `/tools/bing/searchv2` API with the specified query and print out the response received from the API.

2. "According to GWC, 'In 1995, 37% of computer scientists were women. Today, it’s only 24%.'"

The first snippet indicates a change from 37% to 18% between 1984 and 2014, which is a 19% decrease over 30 years. However, we are looking for a 13% change.

The second snippet provides the information that in 1995, there were 37% women in computer science, and "today" (the date of the source is not provided, but for the purpose of this task, we will assume it is the current date of the data provided), it is 24%. This is a 13% decrease.

Since the exact year of "today" is not given in the snippet, we cannot determine the exact number of years it took for this change to occur. However, if we assume that "today" refers to the year the data was reported, which is not specified in the context provided, we would need that year to calculate the number of years it took for the percentage to change by 13% from a starting point of 37%.

Without the current year or the year the data was reported, we cannot calculate the number of years. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot determine the number of years it took for the percentage to change by 13% from a starting point of 37%.

2024-01-06 14:17:25,035 - INFO - The task is to determine how long it took for the percentage of computer scientists that were women to change by 13% from a starting point of 37%, according to Girls Who Code. This task involves finding specific information, which is likely to be contained in a document or on a web page. Since the task does not specify a local file to use, we can assume that the information needs to be retrieved from the internet.

Given the nature of the task, it is appropriate to use an API that can search for relevant information. The '/tools/bing/searchv2' API seems suitable for executing a Bing search to find top web snippets related to the query. However, to extract specific details from a web page, we should use the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API, which allows for detailed content retrieval and specific information extraction.

The task can be decomposed into the following subtasks:

1. Perform a web search to find a source that contains the information about the change in the percentage of computer scientists that were women according to Girls Who Code.
2. Extract the specific information from the web page found in the previous step.
3. Calculate the number of years it took for the percentage change to occur.

Here is the JSON representation of the subtasks:

```json
{
    "search_for_information": {
        "name": "search_for_information",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for information related to the change in the percentage of computer scientists that were women according to Girls Who Code.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "extract_specific_details": {
        "name": "extract_specific_details",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API with the 'query' parameter to extract specific details about the change in the percentage of computer scientists that were women from the web page found in the previous task.",
        "dependencies": ["search_for_information"],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "calculate_years": {
        "name": "calculate_years",
        "description": "Perform a calculation to determine how many years it took for the percentage of computer scientists that were women to change by 13% from a starting point of 37% using the information extracted from the previous task.",
        "dependencies": ["extract_specific_details"],
        "type": "QA"
    }
}
```

This JSON structure outlines the subtasks needed to complete the overall task, with each subtask depending on the completion of the previous one. The final subtask, "calculate_years," is a QA task that will use the information obtained from the previous API tasks to answer the question.

Since the task specifies "Girls Who Code" as the source, we will need to search the internet for this information. This task will involve an API subtask to retrieve the information from the web.

Here is the reasoning process to complete the task:

1. Use an API to search for information related to the historical percentage of women in computer science as provided by "Girls Who Code."
2. Extract the specific information from the search results to find the years it took for the percentage change.
3. Calculate the difference in years based on the information obtained.

Now, let's decompose this into subtasks:

1. **API subtask**: Use the Bing Search API to find information on the web related to the percentage of women in computer science according to "Girls Who Code."
2. **API subtask**: Use the Web browser tool to retrieve detailed content from the target URL obtained from the Bing Search results.
3. **QA subtask**: Analyze the content retrieved to determine the years it took for the percentage of women in computer science to change by 13% from a starting point of 37%.

Here is the JSON representation of the subtasks:

```json

2024-01-06 14:20:34,319 - INFO - To complete the task of determining how long it took for the percentage of computer scientists that were women to change by 13% from a starting point of 37%, we need to find the relevant information from a reliable source. Since the task specifies "Girls Who Code" as the source, we will need to search the internet for this information. This task does not involve file operations or system operations, so we will not be using the Action List. Instead, we will use the API List to find the necessary information.

The task can be broken down into the following subtasks:

1. Use an API to search for information related to the change in the percentage of women computer scientists as reported by Girls Who Code.
2. Extract the specific information from the search results to determine the time it took for the percentage to change by 13%.

Here is the JSON representation of the subtasks:

```json
{
    "search_information" : {
        "name": "search_information",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for information on how long it took for the percentage of computer scientists that were women to change by 13% from a starting point of 37%, as reported by Girls Who Code.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "extract_information" : {
        "name": "extract_information",
        "description": "Analyze the search results returned by the 'search_information' subtask to extract the specific information regarding the time it took for the percentage change.",
        "dependencies": ["search_information"],
        "type": "QA"
    }
}
```

The first subtask, "search_information," will use the Bing Search API to find the relevant information. The second subtask, "extract_information," will analyze the search results to find the specific time period in question. This is a QA task because it involves comprehension and analysis of the information returned by the API task.

2024-01-06 14:21:56,559 - INFO - To complete the task of determining how long it took for the percentage of computer scientists that were women to change by 13% from a starting point of 37%, we need to find the relevant information. Since this is a fact-finding task that likely involves historical data or statistics, we will need to use an internet resource to obtain the information. The API List provided includes a tool for executing Bing searches, which can be used to find web snippets related to the query. We can use this to search for information provided by Girls Who Code on the subject.

The task can be broken down into the following subtasks:

1. Execute a Bing search to find information related to the change in the percentage of women computer scientists as reported by Girls Who Code.
2. Extract the specific information from the search results to determine the time it took for the percentage to change by 13% from a starting point of 37%.

Here is the JSON representation of the subtasks:

```json
{
    "execute_search": {
        "name": "execute_search",

        "dependencies": ["execute_search"],
        "type": "QA"
    }
}
```

The first subtask, "execute_search," does not depend on any other tasks and will use the Bing Search API to find relevant information. The second subtask, "extract_information," depends on the results of the "execute_search" task and involves analyzing the content to find the specific data needed to answer the question. This is a QA task because it requires comprehension and analysis of the information returned by the API task.

# Define the parameters for the API call
params = {
    "query": query,
    "top_k": None  # We can leave top_k as None or set a specific number for the top results we want
}

# Make the API call using the ToolRequestUtil
response = tool_request_util.request(api_path, method, params=params, content_type='application/json')

# Print the return value of the API
print(response)
```

This code will send a GET request to the `/tools/bing/searchv2` API with the specified query and print out the response we receive from the API.

Today, it’s only 24%." Although the current year is not specified in the snippet, we can infer that the change from 37% to 24% is a decrease of 13 percentage points.

To determine the number of years it took for this change to occur, we need to know the year in which the percentage was reported to be 24%. Unfortunately, the snippet does not provide this information directly. However, the context of the search was to use information reported by Girls Who Code, so we can look for additional clues in the search results.

The second snippet from a U.S. News article mentions that "In 1984, 37 percent of computer science majors were women, but by 2014 that number had dropped to 18 percent." This provides a timeframe for a different set of percentages, but it does not directly answer the question regarding the change from 37% to 24%.

Without a specific year mentioned for when the percentage of women in computer science was 24%, we cannot accurately calculate the number of years it took for the percentage to change by 13% from the starting point of 37%. Additional information or a specific year when the 24% figure was reported would be necessary to answer the question.

This task will involve an API subtask to search the web for the relevant information and a QA subtask to analyze the information returned by the API subtask to answer the question.

Here is the decomposition of the task into subtasks:

1. Use the Bing Search API to find information related to the change in the percentage of women computer scientists as reported by Girls Who Code.
2. Analyze the information returned by the search to determine the time it took for the percentage to change by 13%.

Now, let's create the JSON representation of these subtasks:

```json
{
    "search_information" : {
        "name": "search_information",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for information on how long it took for the percentage of computer scientists that were women to change by 13% from a starting point of 37%, as reported by Girls Who Code.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "analyze_information" : {
        "name": "analyze_information",
        "description": "Analyze the information returned by the 'search_information' subtask to determine the number of years it took for the percentage of women computer scientists to change by 13% from a starting point of 37%.",
        "dependencies": ["search_information"],
        "type": "QA"
    }
}
```

This JSON structure represents the plan to complete the task using a directed acyclic graph of subtasks, where "analyze_information" depends on the completion of "search_information".

Since this is a historical data query and not a mathematical calculation or a file operation, we will need to use an API to retrieve the information from the internet.

The reasoning process is as follows:

1. Use an API to search for information related to the historical percentage of women in computer science as reported by Girls Who Code.
2. Once the information is retrieved, analyze the content to find the specific years where the percentage of women in computer science was 37% and when it changed by 13%.
3. Calculate the difference in years between these two points.

Based on this reasoning, we can decompose the task into the following subtasks:

1. API subtask to search for the relevant information.
2. QA subtask to analyze the retrieved information and extract the years corresponding to the 37% starting point and the 13% change.
3. API subtask to calculate the difference in years between the two points.

Here is the JSON representation of the subtasks:

```json
{
    "search_information" : {
        "name": "search_information",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for historical data on the percentage of women in computer science as reported by Girls Who Code.",
