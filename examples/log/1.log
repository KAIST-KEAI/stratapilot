2023-12-29 00:24:16,711 - INFO - To complete the task, we need to decompose it into several subtasks. The main task is to search for Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog homepage, summarize the content, and download a photo of Zhiyong Wu from HKU. We will need to perform a web search, content summarization, and image search. Here's how we can break down the task:

1. Search for Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog homepage.
2. Summarize the content of the homepage.
3. Search for a photo of Zhiyong Wu from HKU.
4. Save the summary to a text file named wuzhiyong.txt.
5. Download the photo and save it as wuzhiyong.jpg.

Now, let's decompose these steps into subtasks with their attributes:

1. `search_github_blog`:
   - Description: Use the "/tools/bing/searchv2" API to search for Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog homepage.
   - Dependencies: None
   - Type: API

2. `load_blog_page`:
   - Description: Use the "/tools/bing/load_pagev2" API to retrieve detailed content from Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog homepage URL obtained from the previous task.
   - Dependencies: ['search_github_blog']
   - Type: API

3. `summarize_blog_content`:
   - Description: Summarize the content of Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog homepage using the information retrieved from the previous task.
   - Dependencies: ['load_blog_page']
   - Type: QA

4. `search_photo`:
   - Description: Use the "/tools/bing/image_search" API to search for a photo of Zhiyong Wu from HKU.
   - Dependencies: None
   - Type: API

5. `save_summary_to_file`:
   - Description: Save the summary of Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog homepage to a text file named wuzhiyong.txt in the current working directory.
   - Dependencies: ['summarize_blog_content']
   - Type: Code

6. `download_photo`:
   - Description: Download the photo of Zhiyong Wu from the search results and save it as wuzhiyong.jpg in the current working directory.
   - Dependencies: ['search_photo']
   - Type: Code

Here is the JSON representation of the subtasks:

```json
{
    "search_github_blog": {
        "name": "search_github_blog",
        "description": "Use the \"/tools/bing/searchv2\" API to search for Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog homepage.",

        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "save_summary_to_file": {
        "name": "save_summary_to_file",
        "description": "Save the summary of Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog homepage to a text file named wuzhiyong.txt in the current working directory.",
        "dependencies": ["summarize_blog_content"],
        "type": "Code"
    },
    "download_photo": {
        "name": "download_photo",
        "description": "Download the photo of Zhiyong Wu from the search results and save it as wuzhiyong.jpg in the current working directory.",
        "dependencies": ["search_photo"],
        "type": "Code"
    }
}

Hiring We have multiple full-time/internship positions available (focus on language agent and multilingual LLM), please feel free to hit me up with your CV or questions if interested. Research I am boardly interested in different topics in NLP. But at the moment, my research focus on exploring interesting (sometimes surprising) utilities of large language models: To synthesis datasets without human annotation. (ZeroGen, ProGen, SunGen) To explain model decision via natural language generation. (Neon, EIB) To learn a task without training by conditioning on in-context examples. (SAIL, CEIL, EvaLM, survey, OpenICL) I\'m currently obsessed with the idea of "LLM-powered autonomous agents" and have multiple related projects underway.

2023-12-29 08:27:00,693 - INFO - To complete the task of searching for Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog homepage, summarizing the profile and biography, and downloading a photo of Zhiyong Wu from HKU, we need to decompose the task into several subtasks. Here's the reasoning process:

1. Search for Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog homepage.
   - We need to use a search engine to find the GitHub blog homepage of Zhiyong Wu from HKU.
   - This can be done using the Bing search API.

2. Summarize the profile and biography from the GitHub blog homepage.
   - Once we have the URL of the GitHub blog homepage, we need to extract the content.
   - We can use the web browser tool to retrieve detailed content.
   - Then, we need to summarize the profile and biography information.
   - This summarization is a QA task as it involves comprehension and writing.

3. Save the summary to a text file named wuzhiyong.txt.
   - After summarizing, we need to write the summary to a text file.
   - This is a Code task that involves file operations.

4. Search and download a photo of Zhiyong Wu from HKU.
   - We need to use an image search API to find a photo of Zhiyong Wu.
   - This can be done using the Bing image search API.

5. Save the photo to a file named wuzhiyong.jpg.
   - After retrieving the photo, we need to download and save it.
   - This is a Code task that involves file operations.

Now, let's decompose these steps into subtasks and represent them in JSON format:

```json
{
    "search_github_blog": {
        "name": "search_github_blog",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for the GitHub blog homepage of Zhiyong Wu from HKU.",

This JSON represents the directed acyclic graph of subtasks needed to complete the main task. Each subtask has a clear description, dependencies, and type, and they can be executed in a sequence determined by topological sorting based on their dependencies.
2023-12-29 08:27:24,350 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2023-12-29 08:27:24,351 - INFO - To complete the user-specified task, we need to use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for the GitHub blog homepage of Zhiyong Wu from HKU. According to the API documentation, we need to provide a JSON object with the "query" field as required and "top_k" as optional. We will construct the JSON object with the query "GitHub blog Zhiyong Wu HKU" and then use the `ToolRequestUtil` to make the request.

Here is the code to perform the task:

```python
from jarvis.core.tool_request_util import ToolRequestUtil

# Initialize the ToolRequestUtil
tool_request_util = ToolRequestUtil()

# Define the API path
api_path = '/tools/bing/searchv2'

# Define the method to be used for the request
method = 'get'

# Construct the parameters for the API call
params = {
    "query": "GitHub blog Zhiyong Wu HKU",
    "top_k": None  # We can leave top_k as None or specify a number if we want to limit the results
}

# Define the content type
content_type = 'application/json'

# Make the API call and store the response
response = tool_request_util.request(api_path, method, params=params, content_type=content_type)

# Print the return value of the API
print(response)
```

This code will send a GET request to the specified API with the appropriate query to find the GitHub blog homepage of Zhiyong Wu from HKU. The response will be printed out, which should contain the top web snippets related to the query.

2023-12-29 08:28:05,323 - INFO - To complete the task, we need to call the `/tools/bing/load_pagev2` API using the `ToolRequestUtil` tool. We will use the GitHub blog homepage URL obtained from the 'search_github_blog' subtask as the `url` parameter for the API call. Since the task does not specify a particular query to search within the web page, we will not include the `query` parameter.

Here's how we can write the code:

```python

# Initialize the ToolRequestUtil
tool_request_util = ToolRequestUtil()

# Extract the GitHub blog homepage URL from the 'search_github_blog' subtask

# Prepare the parameters for the API call
params = {
    "url": github_blog_homepage_url,
    # 'query' parameter is not required as we are not searching for specific details within the page
}

# Call the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API to retrieve detailed content from the GitHub blog homepage URL
response = tool_request_util.request(api_path='/tools/bing/load_pagev2', method='get', params=params, content_type='application/json')

# Print the return value of the API
print(response)
```

Please note that the actual URL to be used should be the one identified as the GitHub blog homepage of Zhiyong Wu from HKU, which should be extracted from the 'search_github_blog' subtask context. The URL provided in the code above is just an example and may not be the correct one.

2023-12-29 08:29:42,351 - INFO - To complete your task, you would need to follow these steps:

1. **Search for Zhiyong Wu's GitHub Blog Homepage:**
   - Use the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API to retrieve the content from Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog homepage. You have already provided the content retrieved from this API in the context.

2. **Summarize Profile and Biography:**
   - Extract the relevant information about Zhiyong Wu from the provided 'page_content' and summarize it into a concise profile and biography.

3. **Write to wuzhiyong.txt File:**
   - Create a text file named 'wuzhiyong.txt' and write the summarized profile and biography into this file.

4. **Download a Photo of Zhiyong Wu:**
   - Search the internet for a photo of Zhiyong Wu from HKU and download the image. Save the image as 'wuzhiyong.jpg'.

Since I am an AI text-based assistant, I cannot perform web searches, API calls, or file operations directly. However, I can guide you through the process of how you would do it:

**Step 1 & 2: Summarize Profile and Biography**
Based on the provided 'page_content', here is a summary you could write to the 'wuzhiyong.txt' file:

```
Zhiyong Wu is a Research Scientist at Shanghai AI Laboratory. He completed his PhD at the University of Hong Kong at the end of 2021, where he was affiliated with the HKU database group and NLP group under the advisement of Prof. Ben Kao. He also collaborated closely with Dr. Lingpeng Kong. Prior to his PhD, he earned his B.E. degree from the Dept. of Computer Science at Wuhan University in 2017. His graduate studies included internships at Tencent AI Lab and Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. Zhiyong Wu's research interests are broad within the field of NLP, with a current focus on the utilities of large language models, including dataset synthesis without human annotation, model decision explanation via natural language generation, and task learning by conditioning on in-context examples. He is particularly interested in "LLM-powered autonomous agents" and is actively working on related projects. Zhiyong Wu and his team are open to full-time and internship positions, focusing on language agent and multilingual LLM.
```

**Step 3: Write to File**
You would need to manually create a text file named 'wuzhiyong.txt' and write the above summary into it.

**Step 4: Download a Photo**
To download a photo of Zhiyong Wu, you would typically:

- Perform an image search on a search engine or visit HKU's official website or related academic profiles to find a photo of Zhiyong Wu.
- Verify that you have the right to download and use the photo (check copyright and usage rights).
- Save the image to your local device with the filename 'wuzhiyong.jpg'.

Please note that you should perform these steps manually as I cannot execute them for you.

2023-12-29 08:32:36,472 - INFO - To complete the task of searching for Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog homepage, summarizing the profile and biography, and downloading a photo, we need to decompose the task into several subtasks. Here's the reasoning process:

1. Search for Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog homepage using a search engine.
2. Retrieve the content of the GitHub blog homepage.
3. Summarize the profile and biography information from the retrieved content.
4. Save the summarized information to the file wuzhiyong.txt.
5. Search for a photo of Zhiyong Wu from HKU on the Internet.
6. Download the photo and save it as wuzhiyong.jpg.

Now, let's decompose these steps into subtasks and represent them in JSON format:

```json
{
    "search_github_blog": {
        "name": "search_github_blog",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog homepage from HKU.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "retrieve_blog_content": {
        "name": "retrieve_blog_content",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API to retrieve the content of Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog homepage using the URL obtained from the 'search_github_blog' subtask.",
        "dependencies": ["search_github_blog"],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "summarize_profile_biography": {
        "name": "summarize_profile_biography",
        "description": "Summarize the profile and biography information from the content retrieved by the 'retrieve_blog_content' subtask and save it to the wuzhiyong.txt file.",
        "dependencies": ["retrieve_blog_content"],
        "type": "Code"
    },
    "search_photo": {
        "name": "search_photo",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/image_search' API to search for a photo of Zhiyong Wu from HKU.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "download_photo": {

        "dependencies": ["search_photo"],
        "type": "Code"
    }
}
```

Each subtask has been given a name that abstracts the operation it performs, a description that details the operation, dependencies that must be completed before it can be executed, and a type that indicates whether it is a Code or API task. This JSON structure represents the directed acyclic graph of subtasks needed to complete the overall task.

Here's the code to perform the search:

```python
from jarvis.core.tool_request_util import ToolRequestUtil

# Initialize the ToolRequestUtil
tool_request_util = ToolRequestUtil()

# Define the API path and method
api_path = '/tools/bing/searchv2'
method = 'get'

# Construct the query parameters
params = {
    "query": "Zhiyong Wu GitHub blog HKU",
    "top_k": 1  # Assuming we want the top result
}

# Call the API and print the return value
response = tool_request_util.request(api_path, method, params=params, content_type='application/json')
print(response)
```

2023-12-29 08:33:08,391 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2023-12-29 08:33:08,400 - INFO - To complete the user-specified task, we need to call the '/tools/bing/image_search' API using the `ToolRequestUtil` tool. According to the API documentation, we need to send a `GET` request with a JSON body containing the `query` parameter, which is required, and an optional `top_k` parameter that specifies the number of top related images to return.

Since the task is to search for a photo of "Zhiyong Wu from HKU", we will set the `query` parameter to this string. We are not given a specific number of images to return, so we can either omit the `top_k` parameter or set it to a default value, such as 1.

Here is the code to perform the API call:

```python
from jarvis.core.tool_request_util import ToolRequestUtil

# Initialize the ToolRequestUtil
tool_request_util = ToolRequestUtil()

# Define the API path and method
api_path = '/tools/bing/image_search'
method = 'get'

# Define the request body with the query
request_body = {
    "query": "Zhiyong Wu from HKU",
    # Optionally, you can specify the number of images to return with "top_k": 1
}

# Perform the API call
response = tool_request_util.request(api_path, method, params=request_body, content_type='application/json')

# Print the return value of the API
print(response)
```

Note that the `params` argument in the `request` method is used to pass the request body, and the `content_type` is set to `'application/json'` as the API expects a JSON body.

Here's the code to achieve this:

```python
from jarvis.core.tool_request_util import ToolRequestUtil

# Initialize the ToolRequestUtil
tool_request_util = ToolRequestUtil()

# Extract the URL from the context
search_github_blog_result = [

        'link': 'https://lividwo.github.io/zywu.github.io/'
    }
]
url_to_load = search_github_blog_result[0]['link']

# Prepare the parameters for the API call
params = {
    "url": url_to_load,
    "query": None  # No specific query is provided, so we set it to None
}

# Make the API call to retrieve the content of the page
response = tool_request_util.request(
    api_path='/tools/bing/load_pagev2',
    method='get',
    params=params,
    content_type='application/json'
)

# Print the return value of the API
print(response)
```

This code initializes the ToolRequestUtil, extracts the URL from the context, prepares the parameters for the API call, and then makes the call to the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' endpoint. Finally, it prints out the response from the API.

2023-12-29 08:39:10,124 - INFO - To complete the task of finding Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog from Shanghai AI Lab, obtaining the markdown of the page link, and saving it as `wuzhiyong.md` in the working directory, we can decompose it into the following subtasks:

1. Use a search engine to find Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog page.
2. Retrieve the markdown format of the found GitHub blog page.
3. Save the markdown content into a file named `wuzhiyong.md` in the working directory.

Let's decompose these steps into subtasks with their attributes:

- **search_github_blog**: This is an API subtask that will use the Bing search API to find Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog page. It has no dependencies since it's the starting point of the task.
- **retrieve_markdown**: This is an API subtask that will use the web2md API to convert the found GitHub blog page into markdown format. It depends on the `search_github_blog` subtask because it needs the URL of the GitHub blog page.
- **save_markdown_file**: This is a Code subtask that will save the markdown content into a file named `wuzhiyong.md` in the working directory. It depends on the `retrieve_markdown` subtask because it needs the markdown content.

Here is the JSON representation of the subtasks:

```json
{
    "search_github_blog": {
        "name": "search_github_blog",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog from Shanghai AI Lab.",

    },
    "save_markdown_file": {

I am a research scientist at Shanghai AI Lab. I got my PhD degree from the\nUniversity of Hong Kong at the end of 2021, affiliated with the HKU database\ngroup and [ NLP group](https://nlp.cs.hku.hk/). I am advised by Prof. [Ben\nKao](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/kao). I am also working\nclosely with [Dr. Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/index.html).\nBefore that, I received my B.E. degree from the Dept. of Computer Science at\n[Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/en/) in 2017. Throughout my graduate\nstudies, I had great internships in Tencent AI Lab and Huawei Noah\'s Ark Lab.\n\n## Hiring\n\nWe have multiple full-time/internship positions available (focus on language\nagent and multilingual LLM), please feel free to hit me up with your CV or\nquestions if interested.\n\n## Research\n\nI am boardly interested in different topics in NLP. But at the moment, my\nresearch focus on exploring interesting (sometimes surprising) utilities of\nlarge language models:\n\n  * To synthesis datasets without human annotation. ([ZeroGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07922), [ProGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11160), [SunGen](https://openreview.net/forum?id=h5OpjGd_lo6))\n\n  * To explain model decision via natural language generation. ([Neon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11160), [EIB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09603))\n\n  * To learn a task without training by conditioning on in-context examples. ([SAIL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10375), [CEIL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05698), [EvaLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04931.pdf), [survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00234.pdf), [OpenICL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02913))\n\nI\'m currently obsessed with the idea of "LLM-powered autonomous agents" and\nhave multiple related projects underway.

The '__call__' method of this class is designed to save markdown content into a file with a specified name in a specified working directory.

The code output indicates that the task of saving the markdown content to '/home/heroding/桌面/Jarvis/working_dir/wuzhiyong.md' has been completed successfully. The presence of 'wuzhiyong.md' in the list of files and folders in the current working directory confirms that the file has been created as intended. Since there is no 'Next Task' specified, the return value of 'None' from the '__call__' method does not affect the completion of subsequent tasks. The code is sufficiently generalized to allow saving different markdown contents to different file names and directories. However, the code could be improved by not changing the current working directory with 'os.chdir', which is a side effect that could affect other parts of a larger program. Instead, it should open the file with the full path without changing directories. The code handles exceptions during file writing, which is good for error handling, but it lacks detailed comments explaining the purpose of each part of the code, which could be improved for better clarity.",

2023-12-29 08:42:55,205 - INFO - To complete the task of finding the GitHub blog of Zhiyong Wu from Shanghai AI Lab, providing the markdown of the page link, and saving it as `wuzhiyong.md` in the working directory, we need to decompose it into several subtasks. Here's the reasoning process:

1. Search for Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog using an internet search API.
2. Retrieve the markdown format of the blog page using a web to markdown conversion API.
3. Save the markdown content to a file named `wuzhiyong.md` in the working directory.

Now, let's decompose these steps into subtasks:

- **Subtask 1: Search for Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog**
  - We will use the Bing search API to find the GitHub blog of Zhiyong Wu.
  - This is an API subtask.
  - There are no dependencies for this subtask.

- **Subtask 2: Convert the blog page to markdown**
  - After obtaining the URL of Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog, we will use the web to markdown API to convert the page into markdown format.
  - This is an API subtask.
  - It depends on the completion of the search subtask.

- **Subtask 3: Save the markdown content**
  - Once we have the markdown content, we need to save it to a file named `wuzhiyong.md` in the working directory.
  - This is a Code subtask.
  - It depends on the completion of the conversion subtask.

Here is the JSON representation of the subtasks:

```json
{
    "search_github_blog": {
        "name": "search_github_blog",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog from Shanghai AI Lab.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "convert_to_markdown": {
        "name": "convert_to_markdown",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/markdown/web2md' API to convert the GitHub blog page to markdown format using the URL obtained from the search_github_blog subtask.",
        "dependencies": ["search_github_blog"],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "save_markdown_file": {
        "name": "save_markdown_file",
        "description": "Save the markdown content obtained from the convert_to_markdown subtask to a file named 'wuzhiyong.md' in the working directory.",
        "dependencies": ["convert_to_markdown"],
        "type": "Code"
    }
}
```

This JSON structure represents the directed acyclic graph of subtasks that, when executed in order of their dependencies, will complete the entire task.

```python

# Initialize the ToolRequestUtil
tool_request_util = ToolRequestUtil()

# Extract the URL of Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog from the search results

    # ... other search results ...
]

# Assuming the first result is the correct GitHub blog page
github_blog_url = search_results[0]['link']

# Prepare the parameters for the API call
params = {
    "url": github_blog_url
}

# Call the '/tools/markdown/web2md' API to convert the GitHub blog page to markdown format
response = tool_request_util.request(api_path="/tools/markdown/web2md", method="get", params=params, content_type="application/json")

# Print the return value of the API
print(response)
```

Please note that the actual implementation may vary depending on the specific details of the `ToolRequestUtil` class and how it handles the `request` method parameters. The above code assumes that the `params` argument is used to pass the request body for a `GET` request, which is not typical for REST APIs. Usually, a `GET` request would use query parameters rather than a request body. If the `ToolRequestUtil` class expects query parameters for a `GET` request, the code would need to be adjusted accordingly.

I am a research scientist at Shanghai AI Lab. I got my PhD degree from the\nUniversity of Hong Kong at the end of 2021, affiliated with the HKU database\ngroup and [ NLP group](https://nlp.cs.hku.hk/). I am advised by Prof. [Ben\nKao](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/kao). I am also working\nclosely with [Dr. Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/index.html).\nBefore that, I received my B.E. degree from the Dept. of Computer Science at\n[Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/en/) in 2017. Throughout my graduate\nstudies, I had great internships in Tencent AI Lab and Huawei Noah\'s Ark Lab.\n\n## Hiring\n\nWe have multiple full-time/internship positions available (focus on language\nagent and multilingual LLM), please feel free to hit me up with your CV or\nquestions if interested.\n\n## Research\n\nI am boardly interested in different topics in NLP. But at the moment, my\nresearch focus on exploring interesting (sometimes surprising) utilities of\nlarge language models:\n\n  * To synthesis datasets without human annotation. ([ZeroGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07922), [ProGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11160), [SunGen](https://openreview.net/forum?id=h5OpjGd_lo6))\n\n  * To explain model decision via natural language generation. ([Neon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11160), [EIB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09603))\n\n  * To learn a task without training by conditioning on in-context examples. ([SAIL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10375), [CEIL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05698), [EvaLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04931.pdf), [survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00234.pdf), [OpenICL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02913))\n\nI\'m currently obsessed with the idea of "LLM-powered autonomous agents" and\nhave multiple related projects underway.
