2024-01-04 21:16:39,726 - INFO - The task is to determine the difference in the number of blocks (layers) between the BERT base encoder and the encoder from the architecture proposed in the paper "Attention is All You Need." This task does not involve file operations or internet data acquisition directly; it is a question that requires knowledge about the BERT and Transformer architectures. Therefore, this task can be decomposed into a QA subtask that involves analyzing the information about these architectures to answer the question.

Here is the reasoning process:

1. Understand the architectures of BERT and the Transformer as proposed in "Attention is All You Need."
2. Identify the number of layers in the BERT base encoder.
3. Identify the number of layers in the Transformer encoder from "Attention is All You Need."
4. Calculate the difference in the number of layers between the two encoders.

Since this task is about knowledge and does not involve file operations or internet data acquisition, we will only plan a QA subtask. The description of the QA subtask will be the full content of the original task.

Here is the JSON result for the subtask:

```json
{
    "compare_bert_transformer_layers": {
        "name": "compare_bert_transformer_layers",
        "description": "Determine the number of layers in the BERT base encoder and compare it with the number of layers in the encoder from the architecture proposed in 'Attention is All You Need' to find out how many more blocks (layers) the BERT base encoder has.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "QA"
    }
}
```

This subtask will use existing knowledge about the BERT and Transformer architectures to provide the answer.

2024-01-04 21:16:45,986 - INFO - The BERT base model has 12 transformer blocks (also known as layers). The original transformer model proposed in the paper "Attention is All You Need" has 6 encoder layers. Therefore, the BERT base model has 12 - 6 = 6 more blocks than the encoder from the original transformer architecture.
