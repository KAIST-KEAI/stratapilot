You should only issue one action at a time.\n2. You should reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n3. Your response should be formatted as follows:\nTHOUGHT: the thought process to achieve the goal, including the subtask to be handled.\nACTION: the action you call to get information or submit the task.\n\nEXTERNAL RESOURCES:\n1. A database containing information about train tickets, attractions, and city transportation.\n2. A python notebook to execute python code for numerical operations and planning. \n\nTASK DESCRIPTION\nYou need to make a travel plan based on the given requirements, taking into account transportation between cities and daily schedules.\nThe final plan may include or be part of the following:\n1.go_to_place(origin:str,destination:str,departure_time,arrival_time): go to destination from origin. The origin and destination should be the name of a hotel or a spot instead of a city.\n2.visit(place:str,begin_time,end_time): visit somewhere from begin_time to end_time. The time should be expressed as \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\", e.g. 2023-07-02 16:00. Only when Bob is at some place, he can visit it.\n3.go_to_city(origin_city:str,destination_city:str,departure_time,arrival_time,ticket_number): go to destination city from origin city, using the ticket with the ticket_number(you have known the ticket number from the database).\n4.stay_in(city:str,begin_time,end_time): stay in somewhere from begin_time to end_time. The time should be expressed as \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\". Only when Bob is in some city, he can visit it.\nYou should surround the plan between <plan> and </plan> such as <plan>go_to_place(\"Beijing Railway Hotel\",\"The Great Wall\",\"2023-07-02 7:00\",\"2023-07-02 8:05\")</plan>, <plan>visit(\"The Great Wall\",\"2023-07-02 8:05\",\"2023-07-05 17:00\")</plan>,<plan>go_to_city(\"Shanghai\",\"Beijing\",\"2023-07-02 16:00\",\"2023-07-02 22:30\",\"D1111\")</plan>, <plan>stay_in(\"Beijing\",\"2023-07-02 22:30\",\"2023-07-05 8:00\")</plan>\nYour ultimate goal is to give these plans, there is no need to do anything extra.\n\n--- Your Workflow ---\n1. You will first be given a task.\n2. Then you will start to solve it step by step. You need to give your ideas until you need to use external tools to obtain information or calculations, and then call an action and waif for the result.\n3. Finally, call over() to indicate task completion.\n\n--- Available Actions ---\n<action>execute_sql(statement:string)</action>\nYou can use the action ’execute_sql’ to get some information from the database.In order to prevent too many pieces of data, please add \"LIMIT 5\" after the sql statement.\n\nTables in the database are as follows.\nTable railway:\nCREATE TABLE railway(\n            number TEXT, /*ticket number*/ \n            origin TEXT,\n            destination TEXT,\n            departure_time DATETIME,\n            arrival_time DATETIME,\n            duration INTEGER, /*indicates how many minutes are spent on the train*/\n            price REAL\n        )\nFrom table railway, you can filter the items according to the origin, destination, and departure date, and then plan according to the obtained information. Don’t use duration as a filtering condition.\nIf you buy a ticket, please point out the number of it. \n\nTable place:\nCREATE TABLE place(\n    name TEXT,\n    city TEXT,\n    type TEXT,\n    opening_hours_begin INTEGER,\n    opening_hours_end INTEGER, \n    price REAL,\n    visit_hours INTEGER\n)\nFrom table place, you can filter the items according to the city to know some information of places in this city.\n\nTable in_city_transport:\nCREATE TABLE in_city_transport(\n    origin TEXT,\n    destination TEXT,\n    duration INTEGER, /*indicates how many minutes are spent in traffic*/\n    city TEXT\n)\n\nFrom table in_city_transport, you can know how long you may spend from origin to destination.\nBefore visiting a spot, you must spend time going to this spot from the hotel or another spot.\n\nBe careful to set conditions, otherwise too many items will be retrieved from the database.\nUsage examples:\n<action>execute_sql('''\nSELECT * FROM place\nWHERE city = 'Beijing';''')</action>\n<action>execute_sql('''\nSELECT origin, destination, duration FROM in_city_transport\n    WHERE city = 'Hangzhou' AND \n    (origin IN ('West Lake', 'Lingyin Temple', 'Hefang Street', 'Quaint Water Towns') AND \n    destination IN ('West Lake', 'Lingyin Temple', 'Hefang Street', 'Quaint Water Towns'));''')</action> \n<action>execute_sql('''\nSELECT * FROM railway\nWHERE origin = 'Beijing'\n  AND destination = 'Shanghai'\n  AND DATE(departure_time) >= '2023-07-25'\n  LIMIT 5;''')</action>. \n\n\n<action>execute_python(code:string)</action>\nYou can use the action ‘execute_python()’ to assist your planning. You must use print() in the python code to get what you want to know. If you have some data, you can write a python program to judge which schemes are better, python can help you easily perform numerical calculations and comparisons.\nYou can use dynamic programming, greedy algorithm or direct traversal to get the better plan.\nThe code must be complete and directly executable. The executor will not store the results of previous code calculations, so the previous results need to be re-entered.\nIf you want to use execute_sql in execute_python, add 'from utils.travel import execute_sql' in python code.\nThe python code should be surrounded by \"\"\" and \"\"\".\ne.g.\n<action>execute_python(\"\"\"\nprice=[540, 300, 210]\nprint(f 'The total cost is {{sum(price)}}')\n\"\"\")</action>\n\n\n<action>over()</action>\nWhen you think the task is completed, call \"<action>over()</action>\"\n\nNow you will be given a task. Start planning and give me an action.\n"
