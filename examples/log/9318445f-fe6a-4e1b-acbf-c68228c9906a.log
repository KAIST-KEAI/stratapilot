2024-01-06 17:53:59,647 - INFO - To complete the task of extracting fractions from an image and providing answers to sample problems, we need to perform a series of operations. The task can be broken down into the following subtasks:

1. **Extract Text from Image**: Since the fractions are contained within an image, we first need to extract the text from the image. This is a Code subtask that involves using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to convert the image into text.

2. **Identify Fractions**: After obtaining the text, we need to identify the fractions within the text. This is a Code subtask that involves parsing the text and extracting the fractions that use '/' as the fraction line.

3. **Solve Sample Problems**: For the sample problems that involve fractions, we need to calculate the answers. This is an API subtask that involves using a math calculator API to perform the necessary calculations.

4. **Format and Order Results**: Finally, we need to format the extracted fractions and the answers to the sample problems as a comma-separated list with no whitespace, in the order they appear in the text. This is a QA subtask that involves organizing and formatting the data.

Here is the JSON representation of the subtasks:

```json

    "extract_text_from_image": {
        "name": "extract_text_from_image",

The class 'extract_text_from_image' inherits from 'BaseAction' and implements a '__call__' method that takes an image path and an optional working directory to perform the OCR operation. The code attempts to change the working directory if provided, checks if the image path is absolute, and if not, it combines the working directory with the image path.

The code does not return any text, which is required for the next task to identify fractions in the extracted text.

2024-01-06 17:56:53,753 - INFO - To complete the task of extracting fractions from an image and providing the answers to the sample problems, we need to perform a series of subtasks. The task involves image processing and mathematical calculations, which are not directly related to file operations or internet data acquisition. However, since the task involves understanding the content of an image, we will need to use an API to convert the image into text that can be processed.

Here is the reasoning process to decompose the task into subtasks:

1. Use an API to convert the image content into text. This is necessary because the system cannot directly interpret the content of an image file.
2. Parse the text to extract all fractions that use '/' as the fraction line.
3. Use an API to calculate the answers to the sample problems.
4. Format the extracted fractions and calculated answers into a comma-separated list with no whitespace.
5. Order the list by the order in which the fractions appear in the text.

Based on the reasoning process, here are the decomposed subtasks in JSON format:

2024-01-06 17:57:15,215 - INFO - To complete the user-specified task, we need to use the ToolRequestUtil to call the '/tools/image_caption' API with the appropriate parameters. Since the API expects a POST request with a multipart/form-data content type and an image file, we will need to provide the image file path as part of the files parameter in the request method.

Here's the code to accomplish this:

```python
from jarvis.core.tool_request_util import ToolRequestUtil

# Initialize the ToolRequestUtil
tool_request_util = ToolRequestUtil()

# Define the API path
api_path = '/tools/image_caption'

# Define the method to be used (POST)
method = 'post'

# Define the content type
content_type = 'multipart/form-data'

# Define the file path
image_file_path = '/home/heroding/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/2105d7660150b62c9b52b778082c3ba8bd69ecc463e61343dbf0f6e79c96294a.png'

# Open the image file in binary mode
with open(image_file_path, 'rb') as file:
    # Define the files to be uploaded
    files = {'image_file': file}
    
    # Make the API request
    response = tool_request_util.request(api_path=api_path, method=method, files=files, content_type=content_type)

# Print the return value of the API
print(response)
```

Please note that the `ToolRequestUtil` class definition provided in the prompt does not include a `files` parameter in the `request` method signature. However, since the API documentation specifies that the image file should be sent as multipart/form-data, I've included it in the code assuming that the actual implementation of `ToolRequestUtil` supports file uploads. If the `ToolRequestUtil` does not support file uploads, the code will need to be adjusted accordingly.
