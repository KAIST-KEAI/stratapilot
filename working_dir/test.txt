Hi! I am a research scientist at Shanghai AI Lab. I got my PhD degree from the University of Hong Kong at the end of 2021, affiliated with the HKU database group and NLP group. I am advised by Prof. Ben Kao. I am also working closely with Dr. Lingpeng Kong. Before that, I received my B.E. degree from the Dept. of Computer Science at Wuhan University in 2017. Throughout my graduate studies, I had great internships in Tencent AI Lab and Huawei Noah's Ark Lab.
