2024-01-04 21:12:35,258 - INFO - To complete the task of finding out what species of bird is featured in the BBC Earth YouTube video of the Top 5 Silliest Animal Moments, we need to perform a series of subtasks. Since the task involves obtaining information from an internet resource (YouTube), we will need to use an API to search for the video and extract the relevant information about the bird species.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning process:

1. Search for the BBC Earth YouTube video titled "Top 5 Silliest Animal Moments" using an appropriate API.
2. Once the video is found, extract the details of the video that may contain the species of the bird.
3. Analyze the extracted details to identify the bird species featured in the video.

Now, let's decompose these steps into subtasks:

1. The first subtask is to search for the video on YouTube. Since we do not have a direct YouTube API in the provided API List, we will use the Bing Search API to find the video. This is an API subtask.

2. The second subtask is to load the page of the video to extract the details. This can be done using the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API, which is designed for detailed content retrieval from a target URL. This is also an API subtask.

3. The third subtask is to analyze the extracted content to identify the bird species. This is a QA subtask, as it involves comprehension and analysis of the content.

Here is the JSON representation of the subtasks:

```json
{
    "search_video": {
        "name": "search_video",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for the BBC Earth YouTube video titled 'Top 5 Silliest Animal Moments'.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "load_video_page": {
        "name": "load_video_page",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API to load the page of the BBC Earth YouTube video titled 'Top 5 Silliest Animal Moments' to extract the details.",
        "dependencies": ["search_video"],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "identify_bird_species": {
        "name": "identify_bird_species",
        "description": "Analyze the content extracted from the video page to identify the species of bird featured in the video.",
        "dependencies": ["load_video_page"],
        "type": "QA"
    }
}
```

This JSON structure represents the directed acyclic graph of subtasks that need to be executed in order to complete the main task. Each subtask has a clear description and dependencies that indicate the order in which they should be executed.
2024-01-04 21:12:35,258 - INFO - The current subtask is: Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for the BBC Earth YouTube video titled 'Top 5 Silliest Animal Moments'.
2024-01-04 21:12:59,083 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2024-01-04 21:12:59,084 - INFO - To complete the user-specified task, I will use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for the BBC Earth YouTube video titled 'Top 5 Silliest Animal Moments'. I will create a `QueryItemV2` object with the `query` parameter set to the title of the video and then call the API using the `ToolRequestUtil` tool.

Here is the code to perform the task:

```python
from jarvis.core.tool_request_util import ToolRequestUtil

# Initialize the ToolRequestUtil
tool_request_util = ToolRequestUtil()

# Define the query parameters
query_params = {
    "query": "BBC Earth YouTube Top 5 Silliest Animal Moments",
    "top_k": None  # We can leave top_k as None or set it to a specific number if we want to limit the results
}

# Call the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API with the specified query
response = tool_request_util.request(
    api_path='/tools/bing/searchv2',
    method='get',
    params=query_params,
    content_type='application/json'
)

# Print the return value of the API
print(response)
```

This code will send a GET request to the specified API with the query for the BBC Earth YouTube video and print out the response received from the API.
