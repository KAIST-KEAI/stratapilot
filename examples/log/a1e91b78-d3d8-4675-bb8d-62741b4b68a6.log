2024-01-03 13:17:51,409 - INFO - To accomplish the task of determining the highest number of bird species on camera simultaneously in a specific YouTube video, we need to perform a series of steps. Since this task involves analyzing video content, which is not directly supported by the provided Action List or the system's capabilities, we will need to rely on external resources or APIs that can analyze video content. However, there is no direct API in the provided API List that can analyze YouTube videos to count bird species. Therefore, this task would typically require manual observation or the use of specialized software for video analysis, which is beyond the scope of the current system's capabilities.

Given the constraints, the task cannot be completed using the current system and available APIs. However, for the sake of the exercise, let's assume there was an API capable of analyzing YouTube videos for bird species count. We would then decompose the task into the following hypothetical subtasks:

1. Retrieve video content from YouTube.
2. Analyze the video to count the number of bird species on camera simultaneously.
3. Report the highest number found.

Since we do not have such an API, we will stop the decomposition here. If in the future an appropriate API becomes available, we could then create a JSON structure with the necessary subtasks to complete the task. For now, the task remains unachievable with the current system setup.
