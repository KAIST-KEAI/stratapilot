¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B)
(A → B) ↔ (¬B → ¬A)
(A → B) ↔ (¬A ∨ B)
(¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)
¬(A → B) ↔ (A ∧ ¬B)

Which of the above is not logically equivalent to the rest? Provide the full statement that doesn't fit.

2024-01-06 12:16:07,621 - INFO - The given task is to determine which of the provided logical statements is not equivalent to the others and to provide the full statement that doesn't fit. This task involves logical reasoning and does not require file operations or internet data acquisition. Therefore, we only need to plan a QA subtask to analyze the logical equivalences and identify the statement that is not equivalent to the rest.

Here is the reasoning process and the JSON result for the subtask:

1. Analyze the logical equivalences of the provided statements.
2. Determine which statement is not logically equivalent to the others.
3. Provide the full statement that doesn't fit.

The JSON format for the subtask is as follows:

```json
{
    "analyze_logical_statements" : {
        "name": "analyze_logical_statements",
        "description": "Analyze the given logical statements to determine which one is not equivalent to the rest and provide the full statement that doesn't fit.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "QA"
    }
}
```

This subtask will use logical reasoning to analyze the equivalences and provide the answer.

2024-01-06 12:16:38,052 - INFO - To determine which of the given logical statements is not equivalent to the others, we need to analyze each pair of statements to see if they are logically equivalent. Logical equivalence means that the statements have the same truth value in every possible scenario.

Here are the given statements:

1. ¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B) - This is De Morgan's Law, stating that the negation of a conjunction is equivalent to the disjunction of the negations.

2. ¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B) - This is also De Morgan's Law, stating that the negation of a disjunction is equivalent to the conjunction of the negations.

3. (A → B) ↔ (¬B → ¬A) - This is the contrapositive, stating that an implication is equivalent to its contrapositive.

4. (A → B) ↔ (¬A ∨ B) - This is the definition of implication, stating that an implication is equivalent to the disjunction of the negation of the antecedent or the consequent.

5. (¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B) - This is not a standard equivalence. It seems to be a variation of the implication definition, but it's not correct as stated.

6. ¬(A → B) ↔ (A ∧ ¬B) - This is the negation of an implication, stating that the negation of an implication is equivalent to the conjunction of the antecedent and the negation of the consequent.

The statement that does not fit with the rest is:

(¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)

This statement is not a standard logical equivalence. The correct equivalence for the implication (¬A → B) would be (A ∨ B), not (A ∨ ¬B). Therefore, this is the full statement that doesn't fit with the others.
