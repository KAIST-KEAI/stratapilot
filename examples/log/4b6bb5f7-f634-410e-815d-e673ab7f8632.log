2024-01-08 15:17:34,840 - INFO - To complete the task of finding out what the location is called in the official script for Series 9, Episode 11 of Doctor Who, where the Doctor is trapped inside an ever-shifting maze, and to give the setting exactly as it appears in the first scene heading, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Since the task involves obtaining knowledge from an official script, which is likely not present in the local files, we need to search for this information on the internet.
2. We will use the Bing search API to find a relevant web page that contains the official script for the specified episode of Doctor Who.
3. Once we have found the web page, we will use the load page API to extract the specific information from the page, which in this case is the name of the location as it appears in the first scene heading of the script.

Here is the decomposition of the task into subtasks:

```json
{
    "search_script": {
        "name": "search_script",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for the official script for Series 9, Episode 11 of Doctor Who.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "load_script_page": {
        "name": "load_script_page",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API with the query 'Doctor Who Series 9 Episode 11 script' to retrieve the content of the web page that contains the official script.",
        "dependencies": ["search_script"],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "extract_scene_heading": {
        "name": "extract_scene_heading",
        "description": "Analyze the content returned by the 'load_script_page' task to find the first scene heading and extract the location name as it appears in the script.",
        "dependencies": ["load_script_page"],
        "type": "QA"
    }
}
```

This JSON object represents the subtasks needed to complete the main task. The 'search_script' subtask will find the web page with the script, 'load_script_page' will load the content of the page, and 'extract_scene_heading' will analyze the content to provide the exact name of the location from the first scene heading.

2024-01-08 15:17:52,012 - INFO - The current subtask is: Use the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API with the query 'Doctor Who Series 9 Episode 11 script' to retrieve the content of the web page that contains the official script.
2024-01-08 15:18:08,075 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2024-01-08 15:18:08,076 - INFO - To complete the task, I will use the `ToolRequestUtil` to call the `/tools/bing/load_pagev2` API with the appropriate parameters. The `query` parameter will be set to 'Doctor Who Series 9 Episode 11 script' to retrieve the content of the web page that contains the official script.

Here is the code to perform the API call:

```python
from jarvis.core.tool_request_util import ToolRequestUtil

# Initialize the ToolRequestUtil
tool_request_util = ToolRequestUtil()

# Define the API path and the method
api_path = '/tools/bing/load_pagev2'
method = 'get'

# Set the parameters for the API call
params = {
    'url': 'https://subslikescript.com/series/Doctor_Who-436992/season-9/episode-11-Heaven_Sent',  # URL from the search_script context
    'query': 'Doctor Who Series 9 Episode 11 script'  # Query to find the most relevant content
}

# Make the API call using the ToolRequestUtil
response = tool_request_util.request(api_path, method, params=params, content_type='application/json')

# Print the return value of the API call
print(response)
```

This code will send a GET request to the `/tools/bing/load_pagev2` endpoint with the specified `url` and `query` parameters. The response from the API will then be printed out.

Based on the content provided in the context, the first scene heading with the location name is not explicitly included in the excerpt. However, the script does mention the Doctor being trapped in a world unlike any other he has seen, facing the greatest challenge of his many lives, and that he must face it alone. This description is part of the narrative introduction and not a scene heading.

Since the actual scene heading is not present in the provided content, I cannot extract the location name as it appears in the script for the first scene. If the full script was available, I would look further for the formatted scene heading.
