2024-01-06 12:33:04,530 - INFO - Your task is: In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. 

The word that indicates oneself is "Pa" is the nominative form, "Mato" is the accusative form, and "Sing" is the genitive form. 

The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is "Maktay". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is "Tay", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is "Aktay". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as "is pleasing to", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.

The word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is "Apple" is the nominative form, "Zapple" is the accusative form, and "Izapple" is the genitive form. 

Please translate "I like apples" to Tizin.

This task does not involve file operations or Internet data acquisition, so it does not require a Code subtask or an API subtask. Instead, it is a language translation task that can be completed through logical reasoning based on the provided information about the structure of Tizin sentences and the forms of the words provided. Therefore, this task will be decomposed into a single QA subtask.

The subtask will involve the following steps:
1. Identify the verb in the sentence "I like apples" which is "like".
2. Translate the verb "like" into the Tizin root verb for an intense like, which is "Maktay", and use it in its root form since the sentence is in the present tense.
3. Identify the direct object in the sentence, which is "apples".
4. Translate "apples" into the Tizin accusative form, which is "Zapple".
5. Identify the subject of the sentence, which is "I".
6. Translate "I" into the Tizin nominative form, which is "Pa".
7. Arrange the translated words in the Tizin sentence structure: Verb - Direct Object - Subject.

Now, let's create the JSON representation of the subtask:

```json
{
    "translate_sentence" : {
        "name": "translate_sentence",
        "description": "Translate the English phrase 'I like apples' into Tizin by using the root verb 'Maktay' for 'like', the accusative form 'Zapple' for 'apples', and the nominative form 'Pa' for 'I', and then arrange these words in the order of Verb - Direct Object - Subject as per Tizin sentence structure.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "QA"
    }
}
```

Executing this subtask will result in the Tizin translation of the English phrase "I like apples".

2024-01-06 12:46:45,021 - INFO - To translate "I like apples" into Tizin, we need to follow the sentence structure of Verb-Object-Subject. Since "like" in Tizin is expressed as "is pleasing to," the subject (the person who likes) becomes the object in the sentence, and the object (the thing liked) becomes the subject.

Here are the steps to construct the sentence:

1. Verb: Since we are expressing a present liking, we use the root form of the verb "Maktay."
2. Object: The word that indicates oneself is "Pa" in the nominative form, but since it is the object in this sentence, we use the accusative form "Mato."

Putting it all together, the Tizin sentence for "I like apples" is:

"Maktay Zapple Mato."
