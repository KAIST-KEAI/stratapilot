2024-01-03 13:41:47,060 - INFO - To complete the task of finding the name of the location where the Doctor is trapped in Series 9, Episode 11 of Doctor Who, as it appears in the official script for the episode, we need to perform a series of subtasks. The task involves searching for specific information, which is likely to be found on the internet, as it is not indicated that the script or any related documents are present in the current working directory.

Here is the reasoning process to decompose the task into subtasks:

1. Since the information is not available locally, we need to search the internet for the official script of the specified Doctor Who episode.
2. We will use the Bing search API to find web pages that might contain the script.
3. Once we have the search results, we will need to load the content of the most promising web page that seems to contain the script.
4. After loading the page, we will extract the specific information about the first scene heading where the location is mentioned.

Now, let's decompose these steps into subtasks and represent them in JSON format:

```json
{
    "search_script": {
        "name": "search_script",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for the official script of Doctor Who Series 9, Episode 11.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "load_page_content": {
        "name": "load_page_content",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API to load the content of the web page that likely contains the official script for the episode.",
        "dependencies": ["search_script"],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "extract_scene_heading": {
        "name": "extract_scene_heading",
        "description": "Extract the first scene heading from the loaded web page content to find the name of the location as it appears in the official script.",
        "dependencies": ["load_page_content"],
        "type": "Code"
    }
}
```

These subtasks, when executed in order, should allow us to complete the main task.

2024-01-03 13:42:09,908 - INFO - To complete the user-specified task, we need to use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for the official script of "Doctor Who Series 9, Episode 11". According to the API documentation, we need to send a `GET` request with a JSON body containing the `query` parameter. The `top_k` parameter is optional and can be used to specify the number of top results to return.

Here's how we can construct and send the request using the `ToolRequestUtil`:

```python
from jarvis.core.tool_request_util import ToolRequestUtil

# Initialize the ToolRequestUtil
tool_request_util = ToolRequestUtil()

# Define the API path
api_path = '/tools/bing/searchv2'

# Define the method to be used for the request
method = 'get'

# Define the parameters for the request
params = {
    "query": "Doctor Who Series 9 Episode 11 official script",
    "top_k": None  # We can leave this as None or specify a number if we want to limit the results
}

# Define the content type
content_type = 'application/json'

# Make the request and store the response
response = tool_request_util.request(api_path, method, params=params, content_type=content_type)

# Print the response from the API
print(response)
```

This code will send a `GET` request to the specified API with the necessary parameters and print out the response we receive.

2024-01-03 13:42:43,532 - INFO - Based on the provided API documentation and the context given, we need to use the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API to load the content of the web page that likely contains the official script for Doctor Who Series 9, Episode 11. From the context, we can see that the search results have returned several links, but the one that seems most likely to contain the official script is the second link with the title "DW9 - EP 11 Heaven Sent BLUE 240815 - Logo of the BBC" and the link 'http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/scripts/DW9-EP11-Heaven-Sent.pdf'.

We will use this URL to load the content of the web page using the API. Since the API requires a POST request with a JSON body containing the 'url', we will construct the appropriate parameters and make the request using the ToolRequestUtil.

Here is the code to complete the task:

```python
from jarvis.core.tool_request_util import ToolRequestUtil

# Initialize the ToolRequestUtil
tool_request_util = ToolRequestUtil()

# Define the API path
api_path = '/tools/bing/load_pagev2'

# Define the method to be used for the API request

content_type = 'application/json'

# Make the API request and print the return value
response = tool_request_util.request(api_path, method, params, content_type)

This code will call the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API with the specified URL and print out the response, which should contain the content of the web page with the official script for the episode.

Error Analysis:
1. The regular expression pattern used in the original code is `r'INT\.|EXT\.[^\n]*'`, which is incorrect because the `|` operator is not enclosed within a group. This causes the pattern to match either `INT.` at the beginning of a line or any occurrence of `EXT.` followed by any characters except a newline. This could lead to incorrect or no matches if the `INT.` is not at the beginning of a line.

Detailed Explanation:
1. The regular expression pattern has been modified to `r'(INT\.|EXT\.)[^\n]*'` to correctly group the `INT.` and `EXT.` options together. This ensures that the pattern will match either `INT.` or `EXT.` followed by any characters except a newline, which is the intended behavior for extracting scene headings.
