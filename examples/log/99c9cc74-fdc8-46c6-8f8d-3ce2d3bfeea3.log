2024-01-06 14:45:42,357 - INFO - Your task is: Hi, I'm making a pie but I could use some help with my shopping list. I have everything I need for the crust, but I'm not sure about the filling. I got the recipe from my friend Aditi, but she left it as a voice memo and the speaker on my phone is buzzing so I can't quite make out what she's saying. Could you please listen to the recipe and list all of the ingredients that my friend described? I only want the ingredients for the filling, as I have everything I need to make my favorite pie crust. I've attached the recipe as Strawberry pie.mp3.

In your response, please only list the ingredients, not any measurements. So if the recipe calls for "a pinch of salt" or "two cups of ripe strawberries" the ingredients on the list would be "salt" and "ripe strawberries".

Please format your response as a comma separated list of ingredients. Also, please alphabetize the ingredients.

2024-01-06 14:46:16,359 - INFO - To complete the task of listing the ingredients for the pie filling from an audio file, we need to perform the following subtasks:

1. Convert the audio file to text to be able to analyze its content. This is a task that requires the use of an API to convert the audio file to text.
2. Extract the ingredients from the converted text. This is a QA subtask that involves analyzing the text content to identify and list the ingredients.

Let's decompose these into subtasks:

Subtask 1: Convert the audio file to text
- Name: "convert_audio_to_text"
- Description: "Use the '/tools/audio2text' API to convert the audio file at '/home/heroding/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/b02de4e4dea2e316629b43f29ee7e2f7c793b6f7970dabb52bf8a77ba9dd4670.mp3' to natural language text."
- Dependencies: []
- Type: "API"

Subtask 2: Extract and list the ingredients from the text
- Name: "list_ingredients"
- Description: "Analyze the text content returned by the 'convert_audio_to_text' subtask to identify and list all the ingredients mentioned for the pie filling, excluding any measurements. Format the response as a comma-separated list and alphabetize the ingredients."
- Dependencies: ["convert_audio_to_text"]
- Type: "QA"

Here is the JSON representation of the subtasks:

```json
{
    "convert_audio_to_text": {
        "name": "convert_audio_to_text",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/audio2text' API to convert the audio file at '/home/heroding/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/b02de4e4dea2e316629b43f29ee7e2f7c793b6f7970dabb52bf8a77ba9dd4670.mp3' to natural language text.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "list_ingredients": {
        "name": "list_ingredients",
        "description": "Analyze the text content returned by the 'convert_audio_to_text' subtask to identify and list all the ingredients mentioned for the pie filling, excluding any measurements. Format the response as a comma-separated list and alphabetize the ingredients.",
        "dependencies": ["convert_audio_to_text"],
        "type": "QA"
    }
}
```

Executing these subtasks in order will allow us to complete the task of listing the ingredients for the pie filling.

2024-01-06 14:46:43,148 - INFO - To complete the task, we need to use the ToolRequestUtil to send a request to the '/tools/audio2text' API. According to the API documentation, the request should be a GET request with a JSON body containing the audio file in binary format. The 'file' field is required in the JSON body.

Here's how you can complete the code:

```python
from jarvis.core.tool_request_util import ToolRequestUtil

# Initialize the ToolRequestUtil
tool_request_util = ToolRequestUtil()

# Define the API path
api_path = '/tools/audio2text'

# Define the method to be used for the request
method = 'get'

# Read the binary content of the audio file
with open('/home/heroding/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/b02de4e4dea2e316629b43f29ee7e2f7c793b6f7970dabb52bf8a77ba9dd4670.mp3', 'rb') as audio_file:
    audio_content = audio_file.read()

# Define the parameters with the audio file content
params = {
    'file': audio_content
}

# Define the content type of the request
content_type = 'application/json'

# Make the request to the API
response = tool_request_util.request(api_path, method, params=params, content_type=content_type)

# Print the return value of the API
print(response)
```

This code will read the audio file, send it to the '/tools/audio2text' API, and print the response, which should be the natural language text converted from the audio.
