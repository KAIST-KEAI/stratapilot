2024-02-05 16:59:35,866 - INFO - To accomplish the task of moving text files containing the word 'agent' from the folder named 'document' to the path 'working_dir/agent', we need to decompose this task into a series of subtasks. Here is the step-by-step reasoning process:

1. Identify and list all text files within the 'document' folder.
2. Search each text file for the word 'agent'.
3. Create a list of file paths for those text files that contain the word 'agent'.
4. Check if the destination folder 'working_dir/agent' exists.
5. If the destination folder does not exist, create it.
6. Move the identified text files to the 'working_dir/agent' folder.

Now, let's translate this reasoning into a JSON format with the required attributes:

```json
{
    "list_text_files": {
        "name": "list_text_files",
        "description": "List all text files within the folder '/Users/hanchengcheng/Documents/official_space/github/jarvis/working_dir/document'.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "Code"
    },
    "search_word": {
        "name": "search_word",
        "description": "Search each text file for the word 'agent' and create a list of file paths for those that contain the word.",
        "dependencies": ["list_text_files"],
        "type": "Code"
    },
    "check_destination_folder": {
        "name": "check_destination_folder",
        "description": "Check if the folder '/Users/hanchengcheng/Documents/official_space/github/jarvis/working_dir/agent' exists.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "Code"
    },
    "create_destination_folder": {
        "name": "create_destination_folder",
        "description": "Create the folder '/Users/hanchengcheng/Documents/official_space/github/jarvis/working_dir/agent' if it does not exist.",
        "dependencies": ["check_destination_folder"],
        "type": "Code"
    },
    "move_files": {
        "name": "move_files",
        "description": "Move the text files from the list created by 'search_word' to the folder '/Users/hanchengcheng/Documents/official_space/github/jarvis/working_dir/agent'.",
        "dependencies": ["search_word", "create_destination_folder"],

The code output indicates that files 1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txt, and 4.txt were successfully moved to the specified destination folder. The task description requires moving text files created by 'search_word' to a specific folder. Since the code output shows that files were moved to the correct destination and the task execution was completed without errors, the task is considered complete. The code handles exceptions such as FileNotFoundError and PermissionError, which adds to its generality. However, the code does not handle cases where the files to be moved are not text files, nor does it check if the files are the result of the 'search_word' task. The code also does not return any value that could be used by subsequent tasks, but since the 'Next Task' is empty, this is not a requirement for the current task. The code is moderately general, as it can be used to move any files, not just text files, and it includes basic error handling.",
