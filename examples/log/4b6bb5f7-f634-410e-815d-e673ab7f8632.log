2024-01-05 22:05:02,327 - INFO - To complete the task of finding out what the location is called in the official script for Series 9, Episode 11 of Doctor Who, where the Doctor is trapped inside an ever-shifting maze, and to give the setting exactly as it appears in the first scene heading, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Since the task involves obtaining knowledge from an external source (the official script for a Doctor Who episode), we need to use an API to search for this information on the internet.
2. We will use the "/tools/bing/searchv2" API to search for the official script of Doctor Who Series 9, Episode 11.
3. Once we have found a link to the script, we will use the "/tools/bing/load_pagev2" API to retrieve the detailed content of the script.
4. After obtaining the script, we will analyze the content to find the first scene heading and extract the name of the location.

Here is the JSON representation of the subtasks:

```json
{
    "search_script": {
        "name": "search_script",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for the official script of Doctor Who Series 9, Episode 11.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "load_script": {
        "name": "load_script",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API to retrieve the detailed content of the script from the link obtained in the 'search_script' subtask.",
        "dependencies": ["search_script"],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "extract_location": {
        "name": "extract_location",
        "description": "Analyze the content of the script obtained from the 'load_script' subtask to find the first scene heading and extract the name of the location.",
        "dependencies": ["load_script"],
        "type": "QA"
    }
}
```

This JSON object represents the directed acyclic graph of subtasks that need to be executed in order to complete the main task. The "search_script" subtask has no dependencies and will be executed first. The "load_script" subtask depends on the "search_script" subtask, and the "extract_location" subtask depends on the "load_script" subtask. The "extract_location" subtask is a QA task that will analyze the content returned by the previous API subtask to give the final answer to the task.

2024-01-05 22:05:30,276 - INFO - To complete the task, we need to call the `/tools/bing/load_pagev2` API using the `ToolRequestUtil` tool. We will use the link obtained from the 'search_script' subtask as the URL parameter for the API call. The first link in the 'search_script' return_val seems to be the most relevant, as it mentions the full transcript for "Doctor Who: Season 9, Episode 11".

Here's how we can complete the code:

```python
from jarvis.core.tool_request_util import ToolRequestUtil

# Initialize the ToolRequestUtil
tool_request_util = ToolRequestUtil()

# Extract the URL from the 'search_script' subtask result
script_link = "https://subslikescript.com/series/Doctor_Who-436992/season-9/episode-11-Heaven_Sent"

# Prepare the parameters for the API call
params = {
    "url": script_link,
    "query": None  # No specific query is needed as we want the full content
}

# Call the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API to retrieve the detailed content of the script
response = tool_request_util.request(api_path='/tools/bing/load_pagev2', method='get', params=params, content_type='application/json')

# Print the return value of the API
print(response)
```

This code will call the API with the correct parameters and print out the response, which should contain the detailed content of the script from the provided URL.

2024-01-05 22:06:47,434 - INFO - To complete the task of finding out what the location is called in the official script for Series 9, Episode 11 of Doctor Who, we need to locate the script for that specific episode and then extract the first scene heading to identify the name of the location. Since the task involves searching for specific content within a text file, we will need to perform a series of subtasks to achieve this.

First, we need to determine if the script for the episode is available in the current working directory or if it needs to be obtained from an external source. If the script is not available locally, we will need to use an API to search for the script online.

Assuming the script is not available locally, the subtasks can be broken down as follows:

1. Use an API to search for the script of Series 9, Episode 11 of Doctor Who.
2. Once the script is found, use an API to load the content of the script.
3. Read the content of the script to find the first scene heading.
4. Extract the name of the location from the first scene heading.

Here is the JSON representation of the subtasks:

```json
{
    "search_script": {
        "name": "search_script",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for the official script of Series 9, Episode 11 of Doctor Who.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "load_script_content": {
        "name": "load_script_content",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API to load the content of the script from the URL obtained in the 'search_script' subtask.",
        "dependencies": ["search_script"],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "extract_scene_heading": {
        "name": "extract_scene_heading",
        "description": "Read the content of the script obtained from the 'load_script_content' subtask and extract the first scene heading.",
        "dependencies": ["load_script_content"],
        "type": "Code"
    },
    "identify_location_name": {
        "name": "identify_location_name",

}

First, we need to extract the URL from the 'search_script' return value. We will choose the first result as it seems to be the most relevant based on the snippet provided.

```python
# Extract the URL from the 'search_script' subtask result
script_url = "[{'snippet': '<b>Season</b> <b>9</b>, <b>Episode</b> <b>11</b> - Heaven Sent - full transcript Trapped in a world unlike any other he has seen, the <b>Doctor</b> faces the greatest challenge of his many lives. One final test. And he must face it alone... <b>DOCTOR</b>: As you come into this world, something else is also born. You begin your life, and it begins a journey, towards you.

# Since the URL is in a string representation of a list of dictionaries, we need to parse it
import json
script_url_list = json.loads(script_url)
# Get the first URL from the list
url_to_load = script_url_list[0]['link']

# Now we can use the ToolRequestUtil to call the API
api_path = '/tools/bing/load_pagev2'
method = 'get'
params = {
    'url': url_to_load,
    'query': None  # No specific query is needed as we want to load the entire page content
}
content_type = 'application/json'

# Make the API call
response = tool_request_util.request(api_path, method, params=params, content_type=content_type)

# Print the return value of the API
print(response)
```

Please note that the above code assumes that the `script_url` is a string representation of the actual result from the 'search_script' subtask. If the result is already in a suitable format (e.g., a list of dictionaries), you can skip the parsing step and directly use the URL.

1. Use an API to search for the official script of Series 9, Episode 11 of Doctor Who.
2. Once the script is found, use another API to load the content of the script.
3. Extract the first scene heading from the script content.

Now, let's decompose these steps into subtasks:

Subtask 1: Search for the official script online.
- Name: search_script
- Description: Use the "/tools/bing/searchv2" API to search for the official script of Series 9, Episode 11 of Doctor Who.
- Dependencies: []
- Type: API

Subtask 2: Load the script content.
- Name: load_script_content
- Description: Use the "/tools/bing/load_pagev2" API to load the content of the script found in the previous task.
- Dependencies: ["search_script"]
- Type: API

Subtask 3: Extract the first scene heading.
- Name: extract_first_scene_heading
- Description: Analyze the content returned by the "load_script_content" task to extract the first scene heading.
- Dependencies: ["load_script_content"]
- Type: QA

Here is the JSON representation of the subtasks:

```json
{
    "search_script": {
        "name": "search_script",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for the official script of Series 9, Episode 11 of Doctor Who.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "load_script_content": {
        "name": "load_script_content",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API to load the content of the script found in the previous task.",
        "dependencies": ["search_script"],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "extract_first_scene_heading": {
        "name": "extract_first_scene_heading",
        "description": "Analyze the content returned by the 'load_script_content' task to extract the first scene heading.",
        "dependencies": ["load_script_content"],
        "type": "QA"
    }
}
```

Executing these subtasks in order will allow us to complete the entire task.

2024-01-05 22:09:07,604 - INFO - To complete the task, we need to use the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API to load the content of the script found in the previous task. From the context provided, we can see that the search results contain multiple links, but we will use the first link which seems to be the most relevant to the query about the official script of Series 9, Episode 11 of Doctor Who.

Here is the code to call the API with the required parameters:

```python
from jarvis.core.tool_request_util import ToolRequestUtil

# Initialize the ToolRequestUtil
tool_request_util = ToolRequestUtil()

# Extract the URL of the script from the previous task's context
script_url = "https://subslikescript.com/series/Doctor_Who-436992/season-9/episode-11-Heaven_Sent"

# Prepare the parameters for the API call
params = {
    "url": script_url,
    "query": None  # No specific query is needed as we want to load the entire content of the script
}

# Call the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API to load the content of the script
response = tool_request_util.request(api_path='/tools/bing/load_pagev2', method='get', params=params, content_type='application/json')

# Print the return value of the API
print(response)
```

This code will call the API with the URL of the script and without a specific query, as we want to retrieve the entire content of the page. The response from the API will then be printed out.
