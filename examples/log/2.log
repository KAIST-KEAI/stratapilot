2023-12-29 08:51:06,495 - INFO - To complete the given task, we need to decompose it into several subtasks. The main objectives are to search for Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog homepage, summarize the profile and biography, save the summary to a text file, and download a photo of Zhiyong Wu from HKU.

Here's how we can break down the task:

1. Search for Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog homepage using a search engine.
2. Retrieve the content of the GitHub blog homepage.
3. Summarize the profile and biography information found on the page.
4. Save the summary to the file wuzhiyong.txt.
5. Search for a photo of Zhiyong Wu from HKU on the Internet.
6. Download the photo and save it as wuzhiyong.jpg.

Now, let's create the JSON representation of these subtasks:

```json
{
    "search_github_blog": {
        "name": "search_github_blog",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog homepage from HKU.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "retrieve_blog_content": {
        "name": "retrieve_blog_content",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API to retrieve the content of Zhiyong Wu's GitHub blog homepage using the URL obtained from the 'search_github_blog' task.",
        "dependencies": ["search_github_blog"],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "summarize_profile_biography": {
        "name": "summarize_profile_biography",
        "description": "Summarize the profile and biography information from the content retrieved by 'retrieve_blog_content' and save it to the wuzhiyong.txt file.",
        "dependencies": ["retrieve_blog_content"],
        "type": "Code"
    },
    "search_photo": {
        "name": "search_photo",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/image_search' API to search for a photo of Zhiyong Wu from HKU.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "download_photo": {
        "name": "download_photo",
        "description": "Download the photo of Zhiyong Wu obtained from the 'search_photo' task and save it as wuzhiyong.jpg.",
        "dependencies": ["search_photo"],
        "type": "Code"
    }
}
```

Each subtask has a clear description and dependencies that indicate the order in which they should be executed. The 'search_github_blog' and 'search_photo' subtasks do not depend on any other tasks and can be executed in parallel. The 'retrieve_blog_content' subtask depends on the 'search_github_blog' subtask, and the 'summarize_profile_biography' subtask depends on the 'retrieve_blog_content' subtask. The 'download_photo' subtask depends on the 'search_photo' subtask. This forms a directed acyclic graph of subtasks that, when executed in topological order, will complete the entire task.
