2024-01-06 13:11:13,480 - INFO - To complete the task of finding out who nominated the only Featured Article on English Wikipedia about a dinosaur that was promoted in November 2016, we need to perform a series of subtasks. Since this task involves retrieving information from the internet, specifically from Wikipedia, we will need to use an API to get the relevant data.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning process:

1. We need to find the Featured Article on English Wikipedia about a dinosaur that was promoted in November 2016. This will require searching Wikipedia, which can be done using the Bing Search API.

2. Once we have identified the article, we need to extract the nomination information, which includes finding out who nominated the article. This can be done by loading the specific Wikipedia page and searching for the nomination details using the Bing Load Page API.

3. The task does not require any file operations or environment setup, so we do not need to use any actions from the Action List.

Based on the reasoning above, here are the decomposed subtasks in JSON format:

```json
{
    "search_featured_article": {
        "name": "search_featured_article",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for the Featured Article on English Wikipedia about a dinosaur that was promoted in November 2016.",
        "dependencies": [],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "load_nomination_page": {
        "name": "load_nomination_page",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API with the query parameter set to the title of the Featured Article to load the Wikipedia page and find the nomination section.",
        "dependencies": ["search_featured_article"],
        "type": "API"
    },
    "extract_nominator": {
        "name": "extract_nominator",
        "description": "Analyze the content returned by the 'load_nomination_page' subtask to extract the name of the person or entity that nominated the Featured Article.",
        "dependencies": ["load_nomination_page"],
        "type": "QA"
    }
}
```

This JSON object represents the subtasks that need to be executed in order to complete the main task. Each subtask has a clear description, dependencies, and type. The subtasks form a directed acyclic graph based on the dependencies, and executing them in topological order will lead to the completion of the main task.

2024-01-06 13:11:25,184 - INFO - To complete the user-specified task, we need to use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for the Featured Article on English Wikipedia about a dinosaur that was promoted in November 2016. We will construct the query to reflect this requirement and then use the `ToolRequestUtil` to make the request.

Here's how we can do it:

```python
from jarvis.core.tool_request_util import ToolRequestUtil

# Initialize the ToolRequestUtil
tool_request_util = ToolRequestUtil()

# Construct the query
query = "Featured Article English Wikipedia dinosaur November 2016"

# Prepare the parameters for the API call
params = {
    "query": query,
    "top_k": 1  # We want the top result
}

# Make the API call using the ToolRequestUtil
response = tool_request_util.request(api_path="/tools/bing/searchv2", method="get", params=params, content_type="application/json")

# Print the return value of the API
print(response)
```

This code snippet constructs the query to search for the Featured Article on English Wikipedia about a dinosaur from November 2016, sets the `top_k` parameter to 1 to get the top result, and then makes a GET request to the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API. Finally, it prints out the response from the API.

(paraphyletic?)[3][4][5][6] Birds are avian dinosaurs, and in phylogenetic taxonomy are included in the group Dinosauria. Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles[note 1] of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago (mya), although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is a subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201.3 mya and their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The fossil record shows that birds are feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch, and are the only dinosaur lineage known to have survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 mya. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs—birds—and the extinct non-avian dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds. Dinosaurs are varied from taxonomic, morphological and ecological standpoints. Birds, at over 11,000 living species, are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates. Using fossil evidence, paleontologists have identified over 900 distinct genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species (birds) and fossil remains. Through the first half of the 20th century, before birds were recognized as dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold-blooded. Most research conducted since the 1970s, however, has indicated that dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction. Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Evidence suggests that all dinosaurs were egg-laying, and that nest-building was a trait shared by many dinosaurs, both avian and non-avian. While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal, many extinct groups included quadrupedal species, and some were able to shift between these stances. Elaborate display structures such as horns or crests are common to all dinosaur groups, and some extinct groups developed skeletal modifications such as bony armor and spines. While the dinosaurs\' modern-day surviving avian lineage (birds) are generally small due to the constraints of flight, many prehistoric dinosaurs (non-avian and avian) were large-bodied—the largest sauropod dinosaurs are estimated to have reached lengths of 39.7 meters (130 feet) and heights of 18 m (59 ft) and were the largest land animals of all time. The misconception that non-avian dinosaurs were uniformly gigantic is based in part on preservation bias, as large, sturdy bones are more likely to last until they are fossilized. Many dinosaurs were quite small, some measuring about 50 centimeters (20 inches) in length. The first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, with the name "dinosaur" (meaning "terrible lizard") being coined by Sir Richard Owen in 1842 to refer to these "great fossil lizards".[7][8][9] Since then, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums worldwide, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of popular culture. The large sizes of some dinosaurs, as well as their seemingly monstrous and..."dinosaur" is commonly used to describe anything that is impractically large, obsolete, or bound for extinction.[332] Public enthusiasm for dinosaurs first developed in Victorian England, where in 1854, three decades after the first scientific descriptions of dinosaur remains, a menagerie of lifelike dinosaur sculptures was unveiled in London\'s Crystal Palace Park. The Crystal Palace dinosaurs proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replicas soon developed. In subsequent decades, dinosaur exhibits opened at parks and museums around the world, ensuring that successive generations would be introduced to the animals in an immersive and exciting way.[333] The enduring popularity of dinosaurs, in its turn, has resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science, and has frequently spurred new discoveries. In the United States, for example, the competition between museums for public attention led directly to the Bone Wars of the 1880s and 1890s, during which a pair of feuding paleontologists made enormous scientific contributions.[334] The popular preoccupation with dinosaurs has ensured their appearance in literature, film, and other media. Beginning in 1852 with a passing mention in Charles Dickens\' Bleak House,[335] dinosaurs have been featured in large numbers of fictional works. Jules Verne\'s 1864 novel Journey to the Center of the Earth, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\'s 1912 book The Lost World, the 1914 animated film Gertie the Dinosaur (featuring the first animated dinosaur), the iconic 1933 film King Kong, the 1954 Godzilla and its many sequels, the best-selling 1990 novel Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton and its 1993 film adaptation are just a few notable examples of dinosaur appearances in fiction. Authors of general-interest non-fiction works about dinosaurs, including some prominent paleontologists, have often sought to use the animals as a way to educate readers about science in general. Dinosaurs are ubiquitous in advertising; numerous companies have referenced dinosaurs in printed or televised advertisements, either in order to sell their own products or in order to characterize their rivals as slow-moving, dim-witted, or obsolete.[336][337] See also Dinosaur diet and feeding Evolutionary history of life Lists of dinosaur-bearing stratigraphic units List of dinosaur genera List of bird genera List of birds List of informally named dinosaurs List of films featuring dinosaurs Further reading Library resources about Dinosaurs Online books Resources in your library Resources in other libraries University of Southampton (September 29, 2021).
