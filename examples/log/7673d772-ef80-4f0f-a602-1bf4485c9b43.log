2024-01-04 21:27:53,175 - INFO - To complete the task of finding the word that was deleted in the last amendment to the first rule in the article that has "witnesses" in the most titles as of 2021 on the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute, we need to perform a series of subtasks involving web content retrieval and specific information extraction. Here is the step-by-step reasoning process:

1. Retrieve the list of federal rules from the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute.
2. Identify the fifth section of federal rules alphabetically.
3. Within that section, find all articles that contain the word "witnesses" in their titles.
4. Determine which article has the most titles containing the word "witnesses."
5. Access the first rule of that article.
6. Find the last amendment made to that rule as of 2021.
7. Identify the word that was deleted in that amendment.

Based on the reasoning process, here are the decomposed subtasks:

```json

    "retrieve_federal_rules": {
        "name": "retrieve_federal_rules",
        "description": "Use the '/tools/bing/searchv2' API to search for the federal rules on the Cornell Law School website's Legal Information Institute.",

    },
    "access_first_rule": {

2024-01-04 21:29:03,988 - INFO - Based on the provided API documentation and the user-specified task, we need to use the '/tools/bing/load_pagev2' API to load the content of the "Federal Rules of Evidence" section and search for articles with 'witnesses' in the title. The API requires a POST request with a JSON body containing the "url" and "query" parameters.

Here's how you can complete the code:

```python
from jarvis.core.tool_request_util import ToolRequestUtil

# Initialize the ToolRequestUtil
tool_request_util = ToolRequestUtil()

# Define the API path
api_path = '/tools/bing/load_pagev2'

# Define the method to be used for the API request
method = 'get'

# Define the parameters for the API request
# The 'url' should be the link to the "Federal Rules of Evidence" section
# The 'query' should be set to search for articles with 'witnesses' in the title
params = {
    "url": "https://www.uscourts.gov/rules-policies/current-rules-practice-procedure/federal-rules-evidence",  # Example URL, replace with actual URL if different
    "query": "title:witnesses"
}

# Define the content type for the API request
content_type = 'application/json'

# Make the API request and store the response
response = tool_request_util.request(api_path, method, params=params, content_type=content_type)

# Print the return value of the API
print(response)
```

Please note that the URL provided in the params dictionary is an example and should be replaced with the actual URL of the "Federal Rules of Evidence" section if it is different. The query parameter is set to search for articles with 'witnesses' in the title as specified in the task.
